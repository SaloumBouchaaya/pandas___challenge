Module 4 Challenge

# Analyzation
I will analyize standerdized test data from multiple schools, divided by two school types. (Charter & District)

There will be a resource folder with 2 sets of raw data
There will be a .ipynb file with the different data frames and coding behind those data frames.
Data will be displayed in many ways in order to get an idea of how students from different grades & schools are preforming. 
Data will also factor in school budgets. 

# Credits
Raw data is provided by edX.UCB Bootcamp.
