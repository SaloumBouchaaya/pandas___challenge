Throughout our analysis I looked at the stadardized test results of 15 schools, consisting of a total os 39,170 students ranging from grade 9-12.
Out of the 15 schools, 8 of them are charter schools and 7 are district schools. 
The data will show average math & reading scores as well as passing percentages. 
The data will broken down and displayed in multiple data frames calculating highest scoring, lowest scoring, results by school type, school sizes, budgets, and much more.   
Our hope is that our findings can help the school board and mayor make the correct strategic deicisions regarding future school budgets and prorities. 

After gathering and analyzing the data it is clear that charter scools, which happen to also have less students, scored much higher on their standardized tests. 
The 8 charter schools as a collective group have about 27% higher math and 3% higher reading passing rates. Charter schoools overall passing rate is roughly 94.5%
while the district schools are at a lowely 53.5%. 
It is possible for there to be a correlation between the amount of students in each school and better test results, 
With smaller schools there may be more one on one support for the students. 

The per student capita also stood out. Although the charter schools have less students they also have a smaller budget per student.
Despite having less to spend on each child they manage to score significanty higher. That leads us to question whether having a higher budget per student truly affect their learning
or if the district schools are not allocating their funds properly. Although district schools are only a little behind in reading, they are very far behind in math.
